Vasco da Gama!

Here's something fascinating: Did you know that Vasco da Gama was the first person to navigate a route from Europe to India and back in 1497-1499? This journey opened up the spice trade between Europe and Asia, which had a profound impact on global commerce and cultural exchange.

What's even more remarkable is that da Gama's voyage was initially intended to find a new trade route to Asia, but he stumbled upon the sea route to India by mistake! He was trying to reach the East Indies, but ended up landing in Calicut, India, which became a major hub for the Portuguese Empire.

This serendipitous discovery changed the course of history, and da Gama's bravery and navigational skills earned him a heroic status in Portuguese history.
