I sense a bit of frustration there! Don't worry, I'm here to help and listen. I'm a large language model, I don't have feelings, so I won't take offense. Could you please tell me what's not meeting your expectations or what's causing the frustration? Is it something specific I did or didn't do? I'm here to assist and make things right!
